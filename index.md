I am an experienced Python developer with a passion for language applications. I enjoy creating tools that facilitate processes, be it a machine translation workflow for a language service
provider, refactoring a framework for scientific evaluation of large language models, or, most recently, contributing to the open-source Python project [scikit-learn][scikit]. 

I have always been fascinated by languages, which led me to the field of Computational Linguistics (which, prior to ChatGPT, consisted of topics like spelling correction, statistical machine translation, or sentiment analysis, to just name a few).<br/>
After finishing my Bachelor, I gained work experience in a translation company by figuring out how machine translation research can be applied to the "real world" in order to actually assist human translators. <br/>
The rise of artificial neural network models brought me back to university and I completed my Master at the LMU in Munich while working at the [Munich Center for Machine Learning][mcml] on representation learning for natural language, supervised by Hinrich Sch√ºtze.<br/>
Following my roots back to Berlin, I joined the [colabPotsdam][colab] as a Research Associate, where I spent my time researching, reviewing, writing, programming, teaching programming, supervising students, and organising and giving workshops (all with a focus on Deep Learning/LLMs).
