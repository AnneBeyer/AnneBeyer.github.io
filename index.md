I am an experienced Python developer with a passion for language applications. I enjoy creating tools that facilitate processes, be it a machine translation workflow for a language service
provider, or refactoring a framework for scientific evaluation of large language models. In this,
my strong communication skills are a valuable asset in understanding stakeholders needs
and in presenting results to colleagues, customers or the scientific community.

I have always been fascinated by languages, which led my to the field of Computational Linguistics (prior to ChatGPT, topics of interest were spelling correction, statistical machine translation, sentiment analysis and a lot of parsing).<br/>
After finishing my Bachelor, I gained work experience in a translation company figuring out how machine translation research can be applied to the "real world" in order to actually assist human translators. <br/>
The rise of artificial neural network models brought me back to university and I completed my Master at the LMU in Munich while working at the [Munich Center for Machine Learning](https://mcml.ai/research/areab/#b2--natural-language-processing) on representation learning for natural language, supervised by Hinrich Sch√ºtze.<br/>
Following my roots back to Berlin, I joined the [colabPotsdam](clp.ling.uni-potsdam.de) as a Research Associate, where I spent my time researching, reviewing, writing, programming, teaching programming, organising and giving workshops on programming (all with a focus on Deep Learning/LLMs).
