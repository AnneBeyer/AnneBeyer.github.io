I'm a PhD student in the [colabPotsdam](http://clp.ling.uni-potsdam.de/) supervised by David Schlangen. My work is part of the [SFB 1287](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/sfb1287/index), which tries to identfy the limits of variability in language. We interpret these limits as constraints imposed upon a next utterance by the preceeding context, which I try to define as different notions of coherence. I currently focus on the evaluation and analysis of large pre-trained language and dialogue models in terms of how these notions are (not yet) encoded and how they could be used to improve them. 

I have always been fascinated by languages and thanks to a series of lucky coincidences, I ended up studying Computational Linguistics at the University of Potsdam.<br/>
After finishing my Bachelor, I gathered some work experience in a translation company trying to figure out how machine translation research could be applied to the "real world" in order to actually assist human translators. <br/>
The rise of artificial neural network models brought me back to university and I completed my Master at the LMU in Munich while working at the [Munich Center for Machine Learning](https://mcml.ai/areas_of_competence/#representation-learning) on a project on representation learning for natural languages.<br/>
Having grown up in Berlin, I soon felt the urge to leave the south again, though, and now I'm happily back at where it all began (department-wise and thematically), focussing on the intersection between Linguistics and Natural Language Processing.
