I'm a PhD student in the [colabPotsdam](http://clp.ling.uni-potsdam.de/), supervised by David Schlangen. My work is part of the [SFB 1287](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/sfb1287/index), which tries to identfy the limits of variability in language from various angles. In our project, we interpret these limits as constraints imposed upon a next utterance by the preceeding context and study these different notions of coherence in more detail. I currently focus on the evaluation and analysis of large pre-trained language and dialogue models in terms of how these notions are (or are not yet) encoded and how they could be used to improve these models. 

I have always been fascinated by languages and thanks to a series of lucky coincidences, I ended up studying Computational Linguistics at the University of Potsdam.<br/>
After finishing my Bachelor, I gained some work experience in a translation company figuring out how machine translation research can be applied to the "real world" in order to actually assist human translators. <br/>
The rise of artificial neural network models brought me back to university and I completed my Master at the LMU in Munich while working at the [Munich Center for Machine Learning](https://mcml.ai/areas_of_competence/#representation-learning) on a project on representation learning for natural language, supervised by Hinrich Sch√ºtze.<br/>
Following my roots back to Berlin, I'm now back at where it all began (department-wise and thematically), focussing on the intersection between Linguistics and Natural Language Processing.
